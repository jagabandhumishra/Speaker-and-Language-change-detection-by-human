Procedure:
1) Download the whole folder
2) Go to the respective folder by typing (cd <folder location>) in the command prompt
3) type $chmod 777 -R requirements.sh
4) $./requirements.sh  # it will install the required packages
5) type $python3 main.py
6) A popup box will appear, read the instruction carefully, follow it and try to provide you response. (we will record your change point detection efficiency, number of time you are replaying teach utterance and duration you are spending for each utterance )
7) We are highly thankfull for your help in this study.  
 
 Session1: Speaker change study, by listining the audio you just have to mark (yes/no) observing whether there is a speaker change or not.
 Session2: Language Change study, by listining the audio you just have to mark (yes/no) observing whether there is a language change or not (language change happens between English and Hindi ).
 
 Kindly provide around 3-4 hours gap between the two sessions.

Caution: {kindly don't give unnecessery waiting between pressing play bottom to yes/no response bottom (for each utterance), as this is a important parameter to be recorded, else it spoil the whole study}
